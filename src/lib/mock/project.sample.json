  "description": "This project aims to implement a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer from scratch, similar to those used in large language models like GPT-2 and GPT-4. The tokenizer translates raw text into sequences of numerical tokens, which are then fed into a language model for training or inference. Understanding tokenization is crucial because it's at the heart of many unexpected behaviors and limitations in large language models, such as spelling difficulties, issues with non-English languages, and arithmetic problems.",
